	Today, millions of people want to learn or improve their English but it
	is difficult to find the best method. Is it better to study in Britain
	or America or to study in your own country? <br /> The advantages of
	going to Britain seem obvious. Firstly, you will be able to listen to
	the language all the time you are in the country. You will be
	surrounded completely by the language wherever you go. Another
	advantage is that you have to speak the language if you are with other
	people. In Italy, it is always possible, in the class, to speak Italian
	if you want to and the learning is slower. <br /> On the other hand,
	there are also advantages to staying at home to study. You don't have
	to make big changes to your life. As well as this, it is also a lot
	cheaper than going to Britain but it is never possible to achieve the
	results of living in the UK. If you have a good teacher in Italy, I
	think you can learn in a more concentrated way than being in Britain
	without going to a school. <br /> So, in conclusion, I think that if you
	have enough time and enough money, the best choice is to spend some
	time in the UK. This is simply not possible for most people, so being
	here in Italy is the only viable option. The most important thing to do
	in this situation is to maximise your opportunities: to speak only
	English in class and to try to use English whenever possible outside
	the class. <br />
